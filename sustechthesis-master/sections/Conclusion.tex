\section{Conclusion}
Dimensionality reduction is a critical step in scRNA-seq data analysis. A good dimensionality reduction result can greatly aid the downstream analysis such as cell clustering and cell lineage inference.
In this study, I analyzed the structure of VAE model and proposed the model of ZIVA based on the structure of VAE. It models the dropouts in the data and performs effectively dimensionality reduction. I compared the performance of ZIVA with six other methods on different datasets. The result shows that ZIVA has good visualization performance that clearly shows the cell clusters and cell development lineages.
