\section{Conclusion}
Dimensionality reduction is a critical step in scRNA-seq data analysis. A good dimensionality reduction result can significantly aid the downstream analysis, such as cell clustering and cell lineage inference.
In this study, I analyzed the structure of the VAE model and proposed the ZIVA model based on the structure of VAE. It models the dropouts in the data and performs dimensionality reduction effectively. I compared the performance of ZIVA with six other methods on different datasets. The result shows that ZIVA has excellent visualization performance that clearly shows the cell clusters and cell development lineages.
